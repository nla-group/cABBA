* ABBA -- an accelerated ABBA based on adaptive polygonal chain approximation of time series
*
*  Parameters
*  ----------    
*     tol - default=0.1
*         Control tolerence for compression.
*     
*     alpha -  default=0.5
*         Control tolerence for digitization.        
*     
*     sorting - default='2-norm', {'lexi', '1-norm', '2-norm'}
*         by which the sorting pieces prior to aggregation.
* 
*     scl - default=1
*         Scale for length, default as 1, refers to 2d-digitization, otherwise implement 1d-digitization.
*     
*     verbose - default=1
*         Verbosity mode, control logs print, default as 1; print logs.
*     
*     max_len - default=1
*         The max length for each segment, optional choice for compression.
*     
*     string_form - boolean, default=true
*         Whether to return with string form
*
*  Methods:
*  ----------
*     std::string ABBA::fit_transform(std::vector<T>&)
*          Transform time series into symbols.
*
*     std::vector<T> ABBA::inverse_transform(std::string& symbols, T& start)
*          Reconstruct the symbols back into time series.
*
*  Attributes
*  ---------- 
*  parameters - Model, store the parameters of fABBA
